I developed a Java-based tennis racket warehouse system, efficiently handling data storage, retrieval, and user interaction. 
This system stored and managed racket details like company, name, color, and price, with a user-friendly online interface allowing easy browsing, shopping list management, 
and sorting by various criteria. This project exemplifies my Java development skills and aptitude for creating practical, user-centric inventory management solutions.
